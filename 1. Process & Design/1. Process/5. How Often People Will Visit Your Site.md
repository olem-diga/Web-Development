# How Often People Will Visit Your Site

- Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently, while other content remains relatively static.
- A website about fashion trends will need to change a lot more frequently than one that is promoting a service that people do not buy regularly.
- Once a site has been built, it can take a lot of time and resources to update it frequently.
- Working out how often people are likely to revisit your site gives you an indication for how often you should update the site.

- It can often be helpful to set a schedule for when a site will be updated (rather than doing it on an ad hoc basis).
- You will often find that some parts of a site will benefit from being updated more frequently than others.

- Here are some questions to help you decide how often to update your website content...
## Goods / Services

- How often do the same people return to purchase from you?
- How often is your stock updated or your service changed?
## Information

- How often is the subject updated?
- What percentage of your visitors would return for regular updates on the subject, compared with those who will just need the information once?
