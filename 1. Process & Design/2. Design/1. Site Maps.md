# Site Maps

- Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.

- The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site.
- This is known as a ***site map*** and it will show how those pages can be grouped.

- To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called ***card sorting.***

- This involves placing each piece of information that a visitor might need to know on a separate piece of paper and then organizing the related information into groups.

- Each group relates to a page and, on larger sites the, pages can in turn can be grouped together to create different sections of the website.
- The groups of information are then turned into the diagram that is known as the ***site map***.
- Sometimes it can be helpful to ask people who are the target audience to help you group related information together.
- A site map will usually begin with the homepage.
- Additionally, if the site is large and is compartmentalized into sections, each section might require its own section homepage to link to all of the information within it.

- You may need to duplicate some information if it needs to appear on more than one page.
- The pages (or groups of pages) will inform how users navigate through the site.
- Remember to focus on the goals that your visitors want to achieve.
- It is worth noting that the site owner might organize information in a way that is different to what the public expects. It is important to reflect the public's understanding of the subject (rather than just the site owner's understanding of it).
