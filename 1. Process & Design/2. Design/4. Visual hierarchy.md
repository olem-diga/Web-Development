# Visual hierarchy

- Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.
## Size

- Larger elements will grab users' attention first. For this reason it is a good idea to make headings and key points relatively large.
## Color

- Foreground and background color can draw attention to key messages. Brighter sections tend to draw users' attention first.
## Style

- An element may be the same size and color as surrounding content but have a different style applied to it to make it stand out.

- Visual hierarchy refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.
- Images create a high visual contrast and often attract the eye first. They can be used to draw attention to a specific message within the page. In some cases, the right image can succinctly reveal more than an entire page of text.

- The effect of a well-designed visual hierarchy is largely subliminal. Achieving a good hierarchy requires balance; if nothing stands out a site can be rather uninteresting, and if too many aspects are competing for your attention it can be hard to find the key messages. This example has a clear hierarchy which addresses the needs of visitors to the site.
