# How Many People Are Coming to Your Site?

- The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are coming to your site.
## Visits

- This is the number of times people have come to your site. If someone is inactive on your site for 30 minutes and then looks at another page on your site, it will be counted as a new visit.
## Unique Visits

- This is the total number of people who have visited your site over the specified period. The number of unique visits will be lower than the number of visits if people have been returning to your site more than once in the defined period.
## Page Views

- The total number of pages all visitors have viewed on your site.
## Pages Per Visit

- The average number of pages each visitor has looked at on your site per visit.
## Average Time On Site

- The average amount of time each user has spent on the site per visit.
## Date Selector

- Using the date selector in the top right hand corner of the site, you can change the period of time the reports display. When you log in, this is usually set to the last month, but you can change it to report on a specific time period.
## Export

- The export link just above the title that says "visitors overview" allows you to export the statistics on this page for other applications such as Excel.
