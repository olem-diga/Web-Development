# FTP & Third Party Tools

- To transfer your code and images from your computer to your hosting company, you use something known as ***File Transfer Protocol***.
- As the name suggests, File Transfer Protocol (or FTP) allows you to transfer files across the Internet from your computer to the web server hosting your site.

- There are many FTP programs that offer a simple interface that shows you the files on your computer alongside the files that are on your web server. These allow you to drag and drop files from your computer to the server or vice versa.

- There are a wide variety of sites that offer services commonly created by web developers (to save you having to build them yourself).

- Some hosting companies offer tools to upload files to their servers using a web browser, but it is more common to use an FTP program as they are faster at transmitting files.
