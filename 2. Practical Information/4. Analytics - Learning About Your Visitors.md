# Analytics - Learning About Your Visitors

- As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by Google called ***Google Analytics***.
## Signing Up

- The Google Analytics service relies on you signing up for an account at: www.google.com/analytics
- The site will give you a piece of tracking code which you need to put on every page of your site.
## How It Works

- Every time someone loads a page of your site, the tracking code sends data to the Google servers where it is stored. Google then provides a web- based interface that allows you to see how visitors use your site.
## The Tracking Code

- A tracking code is provided by Google Analytics for each website you are tracking. It should appear just before the closing `</head>` tag. The code does not alter the appearance of your web pages.
