# What Are Your Visitors Looking At?

- The content link on the left-hand side allows you to learn more about what the visitors are looking at when they come to your site.
## Pages

- This tells you which pages your visitors are looking at the most and also which pages they are spending the most time on.
## Landing Pages

- These are the pages that people arrive on when first visiting your site. This can be particularly helpful because you may find people are not always coming into your site via the homepage.
## Top Exit Pages

- This shows which pages people most commonly leave from. If a lot of people are leaving from the same page then you might consider changing that page or improving it.
## Bounce Rate

- This shows the number of people who left on the same page that they arrived on. A high bounce rate suggests that the content is not what they were looking for or that the page did not sufficiently encourage them to look around the rest of the site. 
- What counts as a bounce:
	- Clicked a link to another site
	- Clicked on an advertisement
	- Entered a new URL
	- Used the "back" button
	- Closed the browser
